In this exercise you will explore Constraint Satisfaction Problems by implementing the N-Queens problem using symbolic constraints in a Jupyter notebook, and solving it using the Backtracking Search algorithm from AIMA.

To launch the notebook, run the following command from a terminal with anaconda3 installed and on the application path:

    jupyter notebook AIND-Constraint_Satisfaction.ipynb
